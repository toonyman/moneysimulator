# Moneysimulator Blueprint

## Overview

Moneysimulator is a web-based application that provides a compound interest calculator. The goal is to help users understand the power of compound interest and simulate their savings growth over time.

The application was initially rejected by Google AdSense for "low-value content". This blueprint outlines the plan to add more valuable content and features to the application to address this issue and create a more comprehensive financial resource for users.

## Current State

- **Functionality:** A single-page compound interest calculator.
- **Technology:** HTML, CSS, and inline JavaScript.
- **Content:** Minimal content, mostly focused on the calculator itself.
- **Design:** A modern and clean design, but limited to the single calculator page.

## Plan for Improvement

The following steps will be taken to improve the application:

1.  **Refactor Code:**
    -   Move inline JavaScript from `index.html` to `main.js`.
    -   Ensure all code follows modern best practices as outlined in `GEMINI.md`.

2.  **Add More Content:**
    -   Create a "Financial Guides" section with articles on:
        -   The Power of Compound Interest (in-depth)
        -   A Beginner's Guide to Investing
        -   Retirement Planning Basics
    -   Add an "About Us" page.
    -   Add a "Contact Us" page.

3.  **Improve Navigation:**
    -   Add a header with a navigation bar to easily access the new pages.

4.  **Enhance Design:**
    -   Apply a consistent and professional design across all new pages.
    -   Use icons and other visual elements to improve user experience, as suggested in `GEMINI.md`.

## Current Change: Initial Setup and Refactoring

This is the first step in the improvement process. The tasks for this change are:

- Create this `blueprint.md` file.
- Move the JavaScript from `index.html` to `main.js`.
